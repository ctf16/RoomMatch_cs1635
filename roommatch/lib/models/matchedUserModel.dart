//This model is a variation of the unmatched user model, simply adding messages between the two users to the model.
//It is used to display a user's profile once they are matched with the current user. It contains the following information:
// - The user's name (first and last)
// - The user's username and userID
// - The user's affiliated institution
// - The user's age
// - The user's images
// - The user's bio
// - The user's algorithm score
// - The user's preferences
// - The user's messages with the current user

//This model can create a matchedUser from an existing baseUser, or from an existing unmatchedUser
